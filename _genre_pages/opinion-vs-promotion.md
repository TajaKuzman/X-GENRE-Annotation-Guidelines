title:  'Opinion/Argumentation versus Promotion'
---

To differentiate between Opinion/Argumentation and Promotion, you can help yourself with the following criteria:

The **purpose**:
* to promote/sell a product or a service (commercial purpose) --> Promotion. Promotion includes texts where the author "promotes" for instance some food by saying how good is it for your health.
* to express an opinion, share personal experiences with the readers --> Opinion/Argumentation

The **topic** - if the topic is a product/a service, the text is most likely Promotion. Except if the author shares his/her personal experience with the product - then annotate it as Opinion/Argumentation.

**Common features**:
* in Promotion, the author often adresses the reader (use of 2nd person), uses superlatives (the best, the cheapest etc.) and some common words/expressions which are connected with products/services (quality, discount, cheap, experiences, efficiency, offer, professional ...)
* in Opinion, the author often uses 1st person singular form and words/expressions with which the author describes his/her view on a topic (happy, satisfied, content, horrible; slovene: že, še, le, sploh) or certainty about something (of course, surely, for sure, clearly; Slovene: seveda, jasno, (za)gotovo)

❕ Promotional texts always promote something - persuade the reader to buy or do something. If the text advises the reader NOT to buy or do something (e.g., a text that urges the readers not to smoke) and does not promote anything, annotate is as Opinion/Argumentation.
